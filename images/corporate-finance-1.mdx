# Corporate Finance

## Capital Budgeting

### Project Cost of Capital

- The appropriate discount rate for a project is the WACC adjusted for the appropriate risk level of the project.
- Discount nominal expected future cash flows at the nominal required return; discount real expected future cash flows at the real required return.

### Factors management considers when setting their minimum rate of return.

1. Risk level of the division's business
2. Interest rates on the company's debt
3. Investors' expectations
4. Competitors' rate of return
5. Return being serviced by other divisions
6. General economic conditions

- Once a firm has established a desirable target capital structure, it should make financing decisions that are consistent with that target structure.
- The return that investors want to earn on a project is the same as the one they would get form an alternative investment with the same risk characteristics.
- Lender's set interest rates (costs of debt) to reflect a firm's ability to pay debt costs that reflect the earning ability of the firm's total assets, not just the project's assets, as a guarantee of principal and interest repayment.
- Each project has its own cost of capital, and the firm's cost of capital is simply the weighted average of the capital costs of the various projects that the firm has undertaken.
- Projects that offer diversification benefits to the overall firm have effects that are irrelevant to shareholders, because shareholders can easily diversify their portfolios without the help of managers by buying shares of other stock.

### Investment Opportunity Set (IOS)

- Assumptions
  - Project risk is held constant
  - Capital Structure is held constant

### Pure-Play Method: Project Cost of Capital

- Step 1: Estimate the project's relative proportions of debt (D) and equity (E) financing:
  - Use the average of the proxies' capital structure (D/A and E/A), since the proxies are expected to operate in similar lines of business, with the same risk, and whose investors are likely to require a similar degree of financial leverage.
  - MV Equity = Share Price \* No. shares outstanding
  - MV Debt = PV of coupons and principal
- Step 2: Estimate the project's after-tax cost of debt (kd(1-tc)):
  - Use the average of the proxies' borrowing rates
  - Use the firm's marginal tax rate
- Step 3: Estimate the project's cost of equity: ke
  - Unlever the proxies' equity beta to get the average proxy's asset beta
  - Relever the average of the proxies' asset beta at the project's target D/E value to get the project's equity beta
  - Use the CAPM
  - Rf is the rate on government bonds
  - MRP is 5% (historical average)
- Step 4: Calculate the project's WACC:

#### Real Options

The right to do something without an obligation to do it (related to capital budgeting projects)

1. Future Investment Opportunity - benefit extending from a particular project
2. Abandonment Option - option to discard a project
3. Postponement Option - option to delay a project
4. Replacement Option - option to extend the life of an asset/project

### Hard Capital Rationing

- A system by which the maximum capital budget cannot be exceeded

### Soft Capital Rationing

- A system by which the maximum capital budget is regarded as flexible

### Sensitivity Analysis

- Observe changes in output with a given percentage change in one input variable

### Economic Profit

- Economic Profit = NOPAT - $WACC

### Economic Income

- Economic Income = cash flow + ∆Market Value
- Economic Income = cash flow - Economic depreciation

## Capital Structure

- Firms using debt financing must generate sufficient income from operations to claim the interest deductions. A firm that does not pay income taxes and does not expect to become a taxpayer has less incentive to incur additional debt. A firm can carry tax losses forward.
  Additional Debt is beneficial when…
  Expected PV(tax shields) > Expected PV(costs of financial distress) + Expected PV(increase in agency costs)
  A firm's capital structure should probably contain no more debt than its future tax position will let it use. For example, firms in industries with other substantial tax shelter opportunities should have lower leverage ratios than firms in other industries.
  MM Proposition I (No Taxes): Capital Structure Irrelevance Proposition
  Assumptions
  (1) Capital markets are perfectly competitive
  (2) Investors have homogenous expectations
  (3) Riskless borrowing and lending
  (4) Agency costs
  (5) Investment decisions are unaffected by financing decisions
  VL = VU
  MM Proposition II (No Taxes): Cost of Equity and Leverage Proposition
  The cost of equity increases linearly as a company increases its proportion of debt financing
  re = r0 + (D/E)(r0 - rd)
  As leverage increases, the cost of equity increases, but WACC and the cost of debt are unchanged.
  MM Proposition I (With Taxes): Value is Maximized at 100% Debt
  VL = VU + (t\*Debt)
  MM Proposition II (With Taxes): WACC is Minimized at 100% Debt
  re = r0 + (D/E)(r0 - rd)(1-t)
  Cost of Financial Distress (expected)
  (1) Cost of financial distress and bankruptcy - bankruptcy, legal fees, lost trust of customers, foregone investment opportunities
  (2) Probability of financial distress - operating and financial leverage, and management expertise
  Agency Costs of Equity
  (1) Monitoring Costs - supervision of management, corporate governance administration costs
  (2) Bonding Costs - insurance costs for management performance, implied costs of non-compete agreements
  (3) Residual Losses - all other costs
  Costs of Assymetric Information - higher required returns on debt and equity capital
  Signaling
  Acquiring debt tells investors that a firm is confident in its ability to make future interest payments
  Issuing equity tells investors that managers think their firm's stock is undervalued
  The cost of assymetric information increases as the proportion of equity in the capital structure increases.
  Pecking Order Theory
  Managers prefer to make financing choices that are least likely to send signals to investors.
  Preferred Financing Hierarchy

1. Retained Earnings (internal financing)
2. Debt
3. External Equity (newly issued shares)

Static Trade-Off Theory
There is a balance between the costs of financial distress and the tax shield benefits from using debt
VL = VU + (t*Debt) - PV(costs of financial distress)
The optimal proportion of debt is reached at the point when the marginal benefit provided by the tax shield of taking on additional debt is equal to the marginal costs of financial distress incurred from the additional debt.
Fluctuation of Capital Structure Around its Target
(1) Management may choose to exploit opportunities ina specific financing source
(2) Market value fluctuations will occur
Companies in developed countries tend to use more debt with longer maturities than firms in emerging markets.
In presenting the "Law of the Conservation of Investment Value" (The Theory of Investment Value, pg. 72), John Burr Williams argued that since the value of an enterprise is the "present worth" of all its future distributions - whether interest or dividends - it "in no [way] depends on what the company’s capitalization is".
Effect of Personal Taxes
Business Risk
The volatility of cash flows and earnings that arise from the particular business firm in which a firm operates
Financial Risk
The magnification of EPS arising from the use of debt (leverage)
Dilution Effect
Fresh equity, supplied by new investors, reduces the percentage of the firm's equity capital controlled by the original owners
Capital Structure Effects
The value of the firm's (not project's) expected future operating cash flows are the basis for lending and investing decisions.
Use the WACC when discounting the cash flows from a project.
The impact of financing a project's cost of capital is determined by the captial structure of the whole firm
Independent subsidiaries are wholly responsible for its incurred debts and its capital structure is relevent in its capital budgeting decisions.
There are 2 cases where it is important to adjust explicitly for capital structure effects:
1.) When the repayment of a loan is tied to one or more specifi assets (use APV)
2.) When firms adjust their capital structures to conicide with their target capital structures
Adjusted Present Value (APV)
Adjusted Present Value is used to account for financing side-effects in special situations where the financing is based on the asset's capital structure (not the firm's).
1.) Base-case NPV
2.) Financing side-effects
APV = Base-case NPV + Financing Side-effects
VL = VU + T*D = ATCF/r + T*rd*D/rd
…Implies that…
WACC = r(1-T*L) L = leverage ratio???
Leveraged Buyouts involves and asset-specific capital structure. By design, the leverage will decrease over time. Cash flows from aset sales and operations are dedicated to repay debt. The owners of the firm intend to resore its capital strucure tor one that is more normal, typically within 5 to 7 years.
Firms normally treate their preferrred stock payment obligations as though they were fixed. If a firm issues a significant amount of preferred stock particularly if it contains a sinking fund, these payment obligations can impair the credit standing of the firm's debt securities.
The rating agencies give greater equity weight to preferred stock the longer its remaining maturirty. Mandatory convertibles (into common stock) are given more equity weight than standard convertibles, which are given more wight than nonconvertible preferred stock.
Changing Capital Structure
Two ways to change capital structure:
1.) A firm can alter its capital structure slowly by adjusting its future financing mix appropriately.
2.) The firm could change its capital structure quickly through one of the following:
a. Exchange offer
b. Recapitalization offer
c. Debt or share repurchase
d. Stock for debt swap
Changing a capital structure can elicit high transaction costs and signaling effects (positive and negative).
If the distance of a firm's capital structure from its target corresponds to at least one full rating category, some type of one-time transactions to make an immediate change in capital structure is probably warranted. A leverage increase for a significantly underleveraged firm is likely to increase the firm's share price. If the firm is less than one full category away from its rating objective, altering its retention ratio and its external financing mix is probably more cost effective.
Determining an Optimal Capital Structure
1.) Ability to service debt
2.) Ability to use interest tax shields fully
3.) Ability of assets to support det (protection against illiquidity)
4.) Desired degree of access to capital markets
5.) Dynamic factors and debt management over time
Dividends and Share Repurchases: Analysis
Dividend Irrelevance
Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (MM) maintain that dividend policy is irrelevent.
→If dividends are too small, simply sell some of the stock to make homemade dividends.
→If dividends are too high, simply reinvest dividends into more shares of the stock.
Bird-in-Hand Argument for Dividend Policy
Myron Gordon and John Lintner argue that investors place a higher value on current dividends than expected capital gains.
(i.e. the dividend yield component of total return, D1/P0 has less risk than the growth component, g)
A company that initiates a new dividend policy will reduce the required rate of return on its equity, increasing the value of its equity
Tax Aversion
Different tax rates on capital gains and dividend income can influence investors' preferences.
Share Repurchase
A transaction in which a company buys back shares of its own stock with cash
The cash nature of share repurchase is considered similar to a cash dividend, and therefore a close substitute to a cash dividend
Rationales for Share Repurchases
(1) Potential Tax Advantages (differential tax rates on capital gains and dividends)
(2) Share Price Support/Signaling (management signals to investors that its stock is udervalued)
(3) Added Flexibility (unlike dividends, share repurchases are not a long-term commitment)
(4) Offsetting Dilution from Employee Stock Options (repurchases offset EPS dilution caused from the exercise of employee stock options)
(5) Increasing Financial Leverage (share repurchases reduce equity (increase leverage))
Stable Dividend Policy
Focuses on a stable dividend payout, even though earnings may be unstable
Companies look at long-term expected earnings to determine their stable dividend policy
Target Payout Adjustment Model
If Current Payout Ratio < Target Payout Ratio
Expected Dividend = Previous Dividend + (Expected increase in EPS)*(Target Payout Ratio)\*(Adjustment Factor)
…where Adjustment Factor = 1/(number of years over which the adjustment in dividends will take place)
Corporate Governance
Effective Corporate Governance Structures
1.) Define the rights of shareholders and other important stakeholders.
2.) Clearly identify manager and director governance responsibilities to stakeholders.
3.) Provide clear and measurable accountability for managers and directors in assuming their responsibilities.
4.) Provide for fair and equitable treatment in all dealings between managers, directors, and shareholders.
5.) Have complete transparency and accuracy in disclosures regarding operations, performance, risk, and financial position.
staggered-term board of directors good or bad?
Mergers and Acquisitions
Acquisition
Acquirer buys only part part of a target company
Merger
Acquirer absorbs the whole target company
Statutory Merger
It is ordinarily much more cost-effective for shareholders to diversify on their own.
Most acquisition problems assume that additional shares are issued to finance the acquisition.
Bootstrapping
Creating higher EPS through acquisition.
High growth, high P/E acquires low growth, low P/E.
EPSnow↑, EPSfuture↓
Stock Dilution
Theoretical Diluted Price = ((O x OP) +(N x IP)) / (O + N) where
O = original number of shares
OP = Current share price
N = number of new shares to be issued
IP = issue price of new shares
Cash Payment
▫ The acquirer assumes the risk and receives the reward from the synergies present in the merger, while the gain to the target is limited to the takeover premium
Gains to Target = Cash Paid - Target's Pre-merger Market Capitalization
Gains to Acquirer = NPV of Synergies - Gains to Target
Stock Payment
▫ The target assumes some of the risks and reward from the synergies present in the merger

1. Calculate number of new shares issued by acquirer and issued to target's shareholders
2. Calculate value of new firm = VA + VT + S - C … where C = 0, since no cash is paid
3. Divide new firm value by the new number of shares outstanding to get the value of the new firm's stock

Gains to Target = Value of new firm's stock\*Number of shares issued to target's shareholders - Target's Pre-merger Market Capitalization
Gains to Acquirer = NPV of Synergies - Gains to Target
Winner's Curse
▫ The tendency of acquirers to overpay for target firms and results from a competitive bidding process
Managerial Hubris
▫ The tendency of managers to overestimate the potential synergies of the merger
Divestitures
Selling, liquidating, or spinning off a division or subsidiary
Equity Carveouts
1.) New, independent company
2.) New Shares, issued through formal, separate IPO
3.) Separate and distinct management team
Spin-Offs
1.) New, independent company
2.) New Shares, issued proportionately to shareholders of the parent firm
3.) Separate and distinct management team
Split-Offs

1. New, independent company
2. New Shares, exchanged for shares of the parent company
3. Separate and distinct management team

Liquidations
Separation and sale of a firm's assets, usually associated with bankruptcy
Reasons for Divestitures

1. Division no longer first into management's long-term strategy
2. Lack of profitability
3. Individual parts are worth more than the whole - reverse synergy
4. Infusion of cash
